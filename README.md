It contains the following algorithms:

* __SSE__   - Simple Scatter Estimation
* __SSENP__ - SSE with Nonlinear Postprocessing
* __BDASE__ - Basic Demodulation based Analytic Scatter Estimation
* __ADASE__ - Advanced Demodulation based Analytic Scatter Estimation
* __GSE__   - Gradient based Scatter Estimation
* __LSGSE__ - Leves Set based GSE

It is implemented in MATLAB, and requires the Image Processing and the Curve Fitting Toolbox.
